# Issue 16: Describe the U.S. Cyber Command testing and evaluation process, including Developmental Test and Evaluation, Developmental Acceptance, Evaluated Level of Assurance, and Operational Test and Evaluation.

## Testing and Evaluation Process Overview
Testing and evaluation (T&E) must be overseen by the project manager and/or test organizations whenever products are intended for distribution - especially in the domain of
Cyber security. The Cybersecurity Test and Evaluations Guidebook breaks this process into six phases. The below six phases fall under an overarching cyber testing framework conssiting of **prevention** (Ability to protect critical mission functions from cyber threats), **mitigation** (The ability to detect and respond to cyber-attacks and assess resilience to survive attacks and complete critical missions and tasks), and **recovery** (The resilience to recover from cyber-attacks and prepare mission systems for the next fight). 

1. Understand Cybersecurity Requirements
2. Characterize the Cyber-Attack Surface
3. Cooperative Vulnerability Identification
4. Adversarial Cybersecurity DT&E
5. Cooperative Vulnerability and Penetration Assessment
6. Adversarial Assessment

## Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) 
Though testing and evaluation is inherent in all phases, phases 3 and 4 outline the requirements for 
DT&E (Cybersecurity Test and Evaluation Guidebook Version 2.0, Change 1 2020)
 
### Phase 3: Cooperative Vulnerability Identification (CVI)
Consists of detailed planning and execution of cyber vulnerability testing. Key tasks during this phase are:

- Identify known cybersecurity vulnerabilities in hardware, software, interfaces, operations, and architecture
- Assess the mission risk associated with those vulnerabilites
- Determine appropriate mitigations or countermeasures to reduce the risk.

Additionally, CVI is not a single test event; the testing process is a feedback loop as seen below:

```
------>  (RE)TEST  x------- (START)
|                         |
|        ANALYZE  <-------|
|                         |
|------x  FIX  <----------|

```

### Phase 4: Adversarial Cybersecurity DT&E (ACD)
The purpose of this phase is to conduct a cybersecurity DT&E event using realistic threat exploitation 
techniques in representative operating environments.

Assesses the ability of a unit equipped with a system to support its mission while withstanding
cyber threat activity representative of an actual adversary

## Developmental Acceptance
Integrated into phases 3-5. Key tasks are below:
- Auditing of the contractor development environment, tools, and processes
- Cybersecurity standards testing- Operational resilience testing
- System cyber survivability testing

(Cybersecurity Test and Evaluation Process 2018)

## Evaluated Level of Assurance
- Assurance requirements apply to all software delivered by the prime contractor
- All software assurance requirements defined in the contract shall apply to all resused code included and delivered
by the prime contractor and its subcontractors
- All software assurance requirements defined in the contract shall apply to all reused objects included and delivered
by the prime contractor and its subcontractors

(Cybersecurity Test and Evaluation Guidebook Version 2.0, Change 1 2020)

## Operational Test and Evaluation
- **Cooperative Vulnerability and Penetration Assessment (CVPA)**
-- An overt examination of the system to identify all significant vulnerabilities and the risk of
exploitation of those vulnerabilities
- **Adversarial Assessment (AA)**
