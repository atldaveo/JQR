# Issue 14: Describe the following OCO work roles

## Remote Operator (ION, RO)
An Army Cyber Remote Operator, also known as an Interactive On-Net (ION) Operator, is responsible for a myriad of tasks. Most notably the RO / ION's most significant duties include offensive cyber operations, network recon / vulnerability analysis (ION), tool development / testing, and training / mentorship (Interactive On-Net Operator 2025).  

## Mission Commander (MC)
The mission commander is solely responsible for planning / integration of cyber operations, command / control (C2 node), synchronization of operations (between all parties involved), risk management, resource allocation, and coordination with other (external) entities (to deconflict) (Delacruz 2015). 

## Exploitation Analyst (EA)
Collaborates to identify access and collection gaps that can be satisfied through cyber collection and/or preparation activities. Leverages all authorized resources and analytic techniques to penetrate targeted networks (Exploitation Analyst 2025).

## Digital Network Exploitation Analyst (DNEA) and Target Digital Network Analyst (TDNA)
### DNEA
The DNEA analyzes intercepted intelligence information for metadata and content. They use this data to reconstruct and document target networks to judge the intelligence value and maintain target continuity. DNEAs understand and analyze target implementation of communication technologies and digital network systems. They discover methods and suggest strategies to exploit specific target networks, computer systems, or specific hardware and/or software (Digital Network Exploitation Analyst 2025).
### TDNA
The TDNA conducts advanced analysis of collection and open-source data to ensure target continuity, profile targets and their activities, and develop techniques to gain more target cyberspace operations related information. They possess knowledge of target cyberspace technologies and apply skills and knowledge of cyberspace networks and the applications on them to determine how targets communicate, move, operate, and live within the cyberspace domain. TDNAs apply analytical techniques to review relevant content carried in target cyberspace communications. The TDNA uses data from networks of all forms for target development. TDNAs are technology savvy and can be flexible enough to rapidly shift from one target to another. (Target Digital Network Analyst 2025).

## Operational Target Development Analyst (ODTA), Targeteer, and Fire Support Planner
Coordinates, integrates, and synchronizes operational fires in and through cyberspace with geographical combatant commands, component commands, subordinate HQ's, multinational forces, and multi-service HQ's. Fires leverages existing doctrinem the Joint Fire Support Planning Process and Cycle, to integrate fires into CONPLANs/OPLANs and seek cyberspace capabilities to weaponeer targets that support the commander's objectives (Chubb 2025). 

## Cyber Operations Planner
Develops detailed plans for the conduct or support of the applicable range of cyber operations through collaboration with other planners, operators and/or analysts. Participates in targeting selection, validation, synchronization, and enables integration during the execution of cyber actions (Cyber Operations Planner 2025).

## Team Lead and Deputy Team Lead
**Team Lead:** This role entails proficiency in leadership / supervision, mission planning / execution, training / development, reporting / documentation, and resource management (about 2024). 
**Deputy Team Lead:** The deputy is responsible for supporting the team lead in all facets, assuring quality, and admin tasks (about 2024).  

## Language Analyst (LA)
Applies language and culture expertise with target/threat and technical knowledge to process, analyze, and/or disseminate intelligence information derived from language, voice and/or graphic material. Creates, and maintains language specific databases and working aids to support cyber action execution and ensure critical knowledge sharing. Provides subject matter expertise in foreign language-intensive or interdisciplinary projects (Multi-Disciplined Language Analyst 2025).

## Target Analyst Reporter (TAR)
The Target Analyst Reporter (TAR) provides synthesized products to customers by researching, analyzing, and reporting intelligence via appropriate reporting vehicles in response to customer requirements and IAW missions of SIGINT, cybersecurity, and cyberspace operations. They prioritize, assess, evaluate, and report information obtained from SIGINT collection, cyber surveillance, and reconnaissance operations sources. The TAR enhances reporting with collateral information as required, maintains awareness of internal and external customer requirements, and collaborates with other collectors and analysts to refine collection and reporting requirements. The TAR shares target-related information and provides feedback to customers as appropriate. The TAR develops working aids and provides database updates on target activity to enhance and build target knowledge and improve collection. The TAR performs quality control and product-release functions (Target Analyst Reporter 2025).
