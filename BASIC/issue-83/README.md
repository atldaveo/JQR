# Issue 83: In Python, demonstrate the ability to incorporate regular expression processing into a program with matching and capture groups

## Code overview
The Python code in this project uses the REGEX module in order to accomplish the following functions.  This is accomplished as a solution to Advent of Code 2023, Day 1, Part 2.

## Code functionality 

- Read lines of text from "input.txt"
- Ensure all lines from input are processed sequentially
- Identify and extract the first digit and the last digit from each line
-- Spelled out numbers (ie. "one", "two", "three", etc.) are also valid digits 
- Combine the extracted digits into a two-digit number
- Maintain a running total of the calibration values for all lines
- Output the sum of all calibration values

## Code Usage
In order to execute the code use the following steps
1. Ensure that "input2.txt" is saved in the same directory as "solution.py"
2. Open a terminal and navigate current directory to the directory called "issue-83"
3. In the terminal, run command `python3 solution.py`
4. Terminal should output the correct prompted output given the attached input.
5. To check that the input is correct, navigate to advent of code 2023 day 01, part 2 puzzle and submit the part 2 answer.
