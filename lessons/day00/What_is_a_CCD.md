# Understanding the CCD Work Role

## The Cyber Capabilities Developer (CCD) Work Role

???+ quote "What is a CCD"
    A CCD is an innovative, agile, highly skilled practitioner that conducts vulnerability analysis, exploitation research and development, software development, software and user documentation, and implementation of software and hardware capabilities that operate in and through cyberspace. The CCD’s primary objective is to provide capabilities that produce an effect in and throughout cyberspace operations. CCD’s and their capabilities are foundational elements of cyberspace operations and serve as a force multiplier for the Cyber Mission Force and conventional maneuver forces.

Like all of the Cyber Mission Work Roles, there are three levels of certification in the CCD Work Role:

- Basic: all students will be certified at the Basic level upon completing 17D BOLC.
- Senior: the senior certification has a common baseline and several different specialty JQRs, including:
    - Windows Access
    - Windows Persistence
    - Unix Access
    - Unix Persistence
    - Embedded development
    - Radio Frequency (RF)
    - Data Science
    - Infrastructure
    - Mobile (tentative)
  
- Master: master certification requires a developer to certify in two senior specialties and involves a code review of the developer’s experience and projects over many years.

Additionally, per the 2019 JQR, developers may attend broadening opportunities such as:

- CNO Developer Program (CNODP)
- Training With Industry (TWI)
- USMA Instructor
- ACI Researcher
- Defense Digital Services (DDS) Advanced Education Program (AEP)
- Advanced Civil Schooling
- Branch-specific PME

At the time of this writing (Summer, 2023), CCDs that fall under ARCYBER within the Army are eligible for Cyber Assignment Incentive Pay at the values, $1000/month, $1250/month, and $1500/month at the Basic, Senior, and Master levels, respectively. (Officers and warrant officers are not eligible for incentive pay at the basic level)

## JQR

The trainee's mentor will create a JQR repo for them, and orient them to the repository and how it is used to track progress, submit credit for line items, and produce JQR documents.

## Curriculum

This curriculum follows the sections of the JQR by number. The trainee is encouraged to follow the curriculum as they pursue each JQR item. Trainees with expertise in any section of the curriculum can submit contributions to improve the curriculum by following the guidelines outlined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://code.levelup.cce.af.mil/ccds/training/basic/curriculum/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Outcome

Students will understand the CCD work role.
