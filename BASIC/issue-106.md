## ECT Mission
Deploy Expeditionary Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) Teams (ECT) to gain tactical superiority in the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS), Cyberspace, and Information Environment in order to enable the lethality of the Army and Joint Force throughout the conflict continuum. The ECTs close gaps at the tactical edge, employing offensive Cyber,
Information Advantage (IA), and Electromagnetic Warfare (EW) capabilities.
(11th Cyber Battaion 2025)

## ECT Task Organization
ECTs include cyberspace forces, EW CEMA operators, IO officers, a
targeting cell, and intelligence personnel (FM 3-12).

## Inherent capabilities and equipment
- Deploy anti-access/Area Denial (A2AD) zones that prevent the ability for our maneuver formations to shoot, move, and communicate (11th Cyber 2025)
- Enable the readiness of Army formations by serving as CEMA enablers or EW Opposing Forces (OPFOR) at home station training events (11th Cyber 2025)
- Employs OCO, DCO, EW, and IO in support of Army operations (FM 3-12).

## Deployment model
ARCYBER deploys ECTs to provide cyberspace OCO, DCO, IO, and EW support for Army
commands. ECTs have the capabilities to employ OCO, DCO, EW, and IO in support of Army operations (FM 3-12 2017)

## Combatant Command and Alignment
ECTs are strategically aligned with combatant commands; ECTs have a specific geographic area of operation and  specialize in this environment (Pommerleau 2021)
