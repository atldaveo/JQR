# Issue 13: Describe the difference between conducting Cyberspace Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C-ISR) and Cyberspace Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C-SR).

## C-ISR
According to JP 3-12, C-ISR is an activity that synchronizes and integrates the planning and operation
of sensors; assets; and processing, exploitation, and dissemination systems in direct support
of current and future operations.

This function is allows the outputs of cyber operations to be used in a concrete manner by the warfighter. Targeted intelligence 
requirements are collected in order to inform the ground commander of the domain-level situation (in cyberspace).   


## C-SR
C-SR, on the other hand is a more passive form of intel collection. The products gathered using this function does not directly inform
on battlespace decisions, but moreso gauge the environment and analyze adversary behavior.
