# Issue 98: Describe your organization's OPSEC policy
## OPSEC Cycle
- **Identify and protect critical information** (even if it may be unclassified) like deployment dates/location, operations, acquisition, PoI
- **Identify threats** (figure out who the adversary is, what their intentions are, and what they're capable of)
- **Analyze vulnerabilities** (Is there a weakness that an adversary can exploit to uncover critical information?)
- **Assess Risks** (Adversaries' ability to exploit a vulnerability)
- **Apply OPSEC countermeasures** (Prevent an adversary from detecting/collecting critical information)
- **Conduct periodic assessments** (Ensure continuous OPSEC oversight)

## Miscellaneous OPSEC measures:
- Only present ID Cards as required
- Be weary of what is posted on social media
- Don't leave CAC inserted into a computer unattended
- Do not discuss work-related sensitive information over the phone
- Be weary of conducting work activities on a public network
