# Issue 15: Describe the CCDO standard of interaction between a capability development organization and its higher requirements-generating headquarters, including pre-requirement planning, drafting requirements, and interacting with tool champions, product owners

## 1. Pre-Requirements Planning
This phase entails communication with combatant commands in terms of where capability gaps may lie and how to initially address them given the gaps' impact to mission and unit priorities. Once a gap(s) has been identified, capability development teams conduct market research and feasibility studies to determine a best course of action. Shortly thereafter, development team will execute rapid prototyping and testing in order to gauge how to continue with respect to bridging the capability gap(s).

Outcomes: Initial Capability Needs Statement(s) (ICS), Operational Mission Threads (OMT), Preliminary CONOP

## 2. Drafting Requirements
Once gap identification has been finalized, developers will produce capability development documents and capability production document IAW DoDI 5000.87. Then, the development team will identify the tool champions and vendors pertinent to the construction of the new capability and aligning requirements with capability portfolio management efforts. Throughout this phase, the development team will meet with stakeholders and ensure capability development efforts remain aligned with requirements.

Outcomes: Capability Development Documents (CDD), Capability Production Documents (CPD), Test & Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP), Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) (for development cycles)

## 3. Interacting with Tool Champions, Product Owners, and Development Teams
Phase 3 begins on full documentation of requirements. There are three major factions within this phase - the tool champions / end-users, product owners, and development / testing teams. During this phase, the tool champions / end-users will provide feedback to the development / testing teams on usability and effectiveness of the ongoing solution. The product owners will break down high-level requirements into Product Backlog Items (PBI) and align those backlogs IAW the tenets of Agile Sprint Planning (and potentially as issues / features). Given all these products, the development / testing team will then prioritize minimum viable product (MVP) iterations and conduct rapid feedback loops with CI/CD until the capability solution is accepted by the tool champions / end-user.

Outcomes: Sprint reviews / agile demos, validation of capability (via integration in Cyber Range Exercises), Post-Deployment Assessments
