# Issue 101: Describe how an embedded system differs from a desktop computer and server

An embedded system differs from a desktop computer and server in that they are significantly more compact, dedeicated to a specific task, and are typically used to control multiple periphery devices (White 2011). Moreover, embedded systems' compact and minimalist nature necesitate real-time (RTOS), or near-real time operating systems in order to process/send data to IO devices whereas a computer and server use full, x86/x64 architecture with a powerful CPU in conjunction with RAM and large memory storage capacity (Gillis 2024).

# Issue 102: Describe how the limitations of an embedded system impact development

Based on these characteristics, embedded systems are severely limited in its processing, power, and memory resources. As such, code must be conservative; memory must be efficiently managed, compact, and uncomplex. It follows, then, that user interfaces cannot be as rich as what a user would typically see on a desktop computer. In fact, the UI might be so minimal that all the feedback the end user will see may only be a series of LED lights. Development also differs from traditional software in that the limited interactive capability of embedded software makes security, debugging, and integration more challenging. Despite the added complexity of programming software to control hardware, the lightweight nature of embedded systems development prevents the use of comprehensive debugging interfaces, complex encryption, and excessive power usage. As a result, these limitations necesitate a stronger consideration for energy efficiency, robust (yet simple) design, and resource-conscious programming compared to traditional software (White 2011).
