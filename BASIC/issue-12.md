# Issue 12: Read and understand the DNI threat assessments (e.g. National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), DIA/NSA Standard Cyber Threat Model, etc.).

## Summary
Threat assessments overseen by the Director of National Intelligence (currently Tulsi Gabbard) of a variety of issues that pose a foreign threat to national security as compiled by intelligence agencies such as the NSA, DIA, CIA, etc. Threat assessments of the intelligence community are published annually by the DNI and can be found via https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/organizations/mission-integration/nic/nic-related-menus/nic-related-content/nic-publications

However, DIA and NSA publications are found separately thru the websites of the respective and related organizations. Such technical resources from which the DNI derives portions of its more hollistic threat assessments are explained in detail amongst cybersecurity publications https://www.nsa.gov/Cybersecurity/    

Finally, extra-governmentmental agencies may also have an influence on the contents of a DNI threat assessment. For example, organizations like NIST of IEEE may publish findings that may influence cybersecurity or demonstrate new cyber attack vectors. Moreover, foundational cyber threat models may have been adopted from outside entities like the MITRE ATT&CK model.
