# Issue 10: Describe CPT mission types
## National (N-CPT)
- Support CCMD and US government priorities to defend critical infrastructure / key resources (CI/KR) as directed
- Some N-CPT's counter specific malicious cyberspace activity (MCA) IAW USCYBERCOM's DTN priorities
- Maneuver off-DODIN and conduct hunt forward operations (HFO) as specified in appropriate plans or orders to defend specified sectors of US CI/KR
- Augment DODIN, CCMD, or Service CPTs to counter specific adversaries

## DODIN (D-CPT)
- Address DOD enterprise-wide priorities, and operate primarily across the Defense Information Systems Netowrk (DISN)
- Operate flobally across the DODIN to protect high-priority mission requirements, or in response to asssets extending across otherwise unprotected organizational boundaries or enterprise systems
- May overlap with Service CPT's or CCMD CPT's

## CCMD (C-CPT)
- Generally bounded by a geographic CCMD's AOR or functional CCMD's network boundaries
- Operations may overlap considerably with respect to Service networks within a CCMD AOR or smaller JTF AO
- When directed, CPT's fulfill CCMD OPLAN/CONPLAN and exercise requirements

## Service (S-CPT)
- Operate primarily within Service-controlled segments of the DODIN, including service-provisioned networks supporting CCMD's
- May overlap with CCMD CPT operations as a result of service networks within a CCMD AOR or smaller JTF AO
- May directly protect CO within Service-controlled AO's
