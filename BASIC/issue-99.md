# Issue 99: Describe how to safely use a search engine while maintaining OPSEC
- Use HTTPS (Though it does not provide anonymity or hide metadata)
- Use a VPN when using unverified networks 
- Use TOR (Though not completely secure as one stil incurs the following risks)
-- TOR sites still use cookies and tracking technologies
-- Remaining logged onto sites means that personal information is saved and the site will know when the user returns to the site
-- Websites can collect information on hardware
-- Users are still at risk for behavioral and social engineering manipulations
- Employ a cyber persona with few (if any) identifying characteristics and secure applications
